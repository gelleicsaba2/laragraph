# Laravel GraphQL example project

## Database migrations & test data seeds
Schema & data will be created by migrations & data seeds.

## GraphQL API-s instead of REST API-s
GraphQL mutations and queries in Laravel MVC.

## Simple user authentication & registration
After you sign in, get a unique hash with expiration time. Expiration will be longer with the effects of user actions.

## Typescript controllers
All pages or parts of pages have typescript controllers, which are classes for managing client operations.

## Routes
There are always AJAX calls when you change the content.\
Client api (changeRoute) => Get request => Blade template => html response

## Todo management
The usual todo CRUD operations with GraphQL.

## Simple UI controls & Tailwind design
I used very simple html input controls with tailwind css classes. In only one case I use MaryUI (to a single popup menu).

## Unit tests
There are Unit tests to user login/sign up/logout services.
